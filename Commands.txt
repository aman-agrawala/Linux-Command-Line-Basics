#Linux Filesystem:

filesystem stores various kinds of objects.
Two most common are:
	file - like text file, images, program, etc
	directories - named containers that cna hold files, directories, other objects.

Files and directories have names called filenames
Filenames can contain any character except the '/'.
When you write a filename thatcontains spaces or punctuation such as !$#()[]%&; (including space) put the filename in 'quotes' or precede each special character with \
Example: 
Great Filename! can be either 'Great Filename!' (called quoting) or Great\ Filename\! (called escaping)

REMEMBER LINUX uses / to SEPARATE DIRECTORIES - WINDOWS uses \

pwd - stands for print working directory

a fullpath is called the absolute path. This means that it tells every step that needs to be taken from the root (the absolute beginning of the filesystem)

a relative path: is the location relative to current working directory. Does not start with a /

In directories .. moves you up one directory and . refers to the current directory. 
~ refers to home directory

cd by itself takes you to home directory

mv source destination- moves files around, rename files, 

cp source destination - can copy a file. Just list all desired files first and the last directory is the destination always.

mkdir path - makes a new directory

rmdir - removes directory (doesn't work if directory has files in it). If you want to remove a directory and all contents use: rm -r

# Globbing
globbing - matching files by name in unix shell

* means anything fits even no characters.
*pp* means any file with pp in it like pepper or ppl


{options} - any file with those options
app.{css,html} any files with .css or .html at the end

? - matches any one character
ls bea?.png will look for any interation of the word with the ? changed to a character like bear.png or bean.png

[options] - list of characters inside square brackets matches anyone of those characters inside the brackets
be[aeiou]r.png will match bear.png or beer.png

Note filenames in linux are case sensitive and applies to globbing as well
if you want both lower and upper case .jpg or .JPG then use *{jpg,JPG}
